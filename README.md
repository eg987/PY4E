Python for Everyone - PY4E.com Coursework (Dr. Charles Severance)

I've only included files where code needed to be written or changed from the original assignment given. Work was initially completed December 2023-June 2024, then reworked/expanded on for Coursera Courses 2024-2025. It is now being checked against original PY4E.com coursework and uploaded to GitHub July 2025. 

Some exercises were for practice only (not graded), including:
3.02, 4.07, 5.01, 6.01, 6.03, 7.01, 8.02, 8.06, 9.01, 9.02, 9.03,
